# textextractor
Extract text from imaged pages into a text file using pytesseract

Getting started:
1. Ensure that Tesseract OCR is available on your system and pytesseract is available in your python.
* A good guide can be found here:  https://builtin.com/articles/python-tesseract
2. If you are using a language other than English, download the tesseract module for that language.
* A list of languages is here: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Data-Files-in-different-versions.html
* The associated language models are in github here:  https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tessdata
3. Specify settings in config.ini.  In particular, be sure to specify indir, prefix, img_rotate, and lang in the general section.  
4. Pages scan best when things in the margins are cropped out.  Use test_crop.py to help identify the best crop settings

Known issues:

* This code is not production code and has no error trapping.
* This code has only been tested on png images although it probably works with other formats.
* This code assumes that your OCR pages are saved with the format <some prefix>_<some number>.PNG
* When a word is broken at the end of a line with a hypen, the code cannot distinguish between a hypenated word and a word where a hyphen has been injected.  It will remove the hypen when it removes the line breaks introduced by OCR.
* Some book chapters begin with a large character.   The OCR engine, tesseract_ocr, does not handle this well and may skip the character or otherwise introduce weirdness.
* The OCR engine may inject characters if it sees line drawings.  Normal illustrations are usually ok.
* The OCR engine does not always see numbered chapter headings and may also skip breaks in a chapter.
